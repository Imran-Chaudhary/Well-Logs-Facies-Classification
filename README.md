# Well-Logs-Facies-Classification

Facies are the studied from core samples in every half foot and matched with logging data in well location. Facies classification is one of the most important tasks that geoscientists work on development and exploration projects. Sedimentary facies reflect particular physical, chemical, and biological condition that unit experienced during sedimentation process. To study these facies, rock samples are required. In this project, I'll use these log data to train supervised classifiers in order to predict discrete facies groups.

### Data

The data set used came from a University of Kansas class exercise on the Hugoton and Panoma gas fields. For more on the origin of the data, see Dubois et al. (2007). This was a  consortium project to use machine learning techniques to create a reservoir model of the largest gas fields in North America, the Hugoton and Panoma Fields.

Geologically sometimes the boundaries of the facies are not clear and could show some transition, hence following table list the facies, the abreviated labels and approximately next attacching facies.
